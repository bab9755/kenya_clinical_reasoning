# Clinical Reasoning LLM

A machine learning project focused on developing a language model for clinical reasoning and medical decision-making. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing AI-powered clinical reasoning capabilities.

## Project Overview

This project implements a clinical reasoning system using transformer-based language models. The system is designed to process medical case scenarios and generate appropriate clinical responses, similar to how a healthcare professional would reason through a case.

## Features

- Medical case processing and analysis
- Clinical reasoning response generation
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Tokenization and model training pipeline
- Evaluation framework for model performance

## Technical Stack

The project uses the following key technologies:
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- T5 model architecture
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NLTK for text processing

## Setup and Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv clinical_venv
source clinical_venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The project uses a dataset of medical cases with corresponding clinical responses. The data includes:
- Patient scenarios
- Clinical questions
- Expert responses

## Model Architecture

The project uses a T5-based model architecture, which is well-suited for text-to-text tasks. The model is trained to:
1. Process medical case descriptions
2. Understand clinical questions
3. Generate appropriate clinical responses

## Current Status

The project is in active development with the following components implemented:
- Data preprocessing pipeline
- Model architecture setup
- Training infrastructure
- Basic evaluation framework

## Future Work

- Implement more sophisticated evaluation metrics
- Add support for different medical specialties
- Enhance model performance through fine-tuning
- Add support for multi-modal inputs (e.g., medical images)
- Implement real-time inference capabilities
